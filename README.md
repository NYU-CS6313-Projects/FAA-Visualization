MAYDAY - FAA Accident/Incident Visualization
======================

This visualization provides interesting insight into the FAA accident/incident dataset from a temporal perspective.

Current Status: (Development In Progress) The layout of the panels and buttons are scattered at this point due to the amount of emphasis placed on the visualization's functionality. Furthermore, the heatmap needs to hookup with the other visualization panels (barcharts, etc.), and the sidepanel data needs to be formatted neatly.
