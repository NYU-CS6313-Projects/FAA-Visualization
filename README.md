MAYDAY - FAA Accident/Incident Visualization
======================

This visualization provides interesting insight into the FAA accident/incident dataset from a temporal perspective.

Current Status: (Development In Progress) The calendar heatmap has been completed, which affords a general temporal overview over a given 5-year period. There is a bar graph component which displays  frequencies of accidents vs pilot experience. There are several filtiering options vis-a-vis pilot experience as well as accident type. Additionally, there is a choropleth map diplaying accident frequency with resepct to location. Eventually, the map will show a pie chart / bar graph for weather-type with respect to accidents. A slider, located on the bottom, allows the user to select a specific slice of time.
